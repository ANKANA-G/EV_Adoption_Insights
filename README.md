# EV_Adoption_Insights
•	Project Title: Consumer Behaviour Towards Buying an Electric Vehicle(EV)
(May 2024 – June 2024)
[Data-driven analysis of consumer behavior towards electric vehicle adoption in India, using logistic regression, PCA, and behavioral segmentation to uncover actionable insights for market strategy and policy design.]

•	Objective:
-	To understand consumer buying behavior towards electric vehicles
-	To identify key parameters influencing vehicle purchase decisions
-	To assess the growth of the EV industry in India
-	To evaluate consumer perception of internal combustion engines
-	To measure awareness levels of EVs among different demographics
-	To examine barriers such as cost, infrastructure, and battery replacement
  
•	Data Collection:
-	Primary data collected via structured survey
-	Sample size: 448 respondents (266 male, 182 female)
-	Coverage: Urban and rural areas
-	Sampling technique: Random sampling
  
•	Data Processing:
-	Data cleaning and formatting
-	Handling missing values and outliers
-	Encoding categorical variables for analysis
  
•	Model Development:
-	Chi-square test of association
-	One-way ANOVA and Fisher’s test for mean differences
-	Multiple logistic regression models
-	Confusion matrix analysis
-	ROC-AUC curve plotting
-	Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
•	Model Evaluation:
-	Confusion matrix metrics: TP, TN, FP, FN
-	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
-	AIC and AUC values for model comparison
-	Chi-square p-values for significance testing
-	ANOVA and Fisher’s test for group differences
  
•	Visualization:
-	Bar charts and pie charts for demographic insights
-	ROC curve and AUC plots for model performance
-	PCA visualizations: Scree plot, Score plot, Loading plot

•	Project Outcome: 
The study revealed strong consumer awareness of climate issues and a growing inclination toward electric vehicles (EVs), especially among younger and urban respondents. Statistical analysis confirmed significant associations between demographic factors and EV preferences, highlighting cost of battery replacement, and infrastructure limitations as key barriers. Government incentives and policy support play a crucial role in shaping adoption. The findings underscore the need for collaborative efforts between policymakers and manufacturers to build a sustainable, consumer-ready EV ecosystem in India.
